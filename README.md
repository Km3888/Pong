# Pong
A fun side project mean to foster competitiveness amongst ping-pong players at NYU Shanghai. Uses Pandas to load the data collectively contributed by those who logged their games on a Google Sheet. This data is then analyzed to show personal stats, one-on-one matchups, and uses an ELO system based on binomial probabilities to rank players who have played sufficient games. Simply provide the path name of the game records in .csv form.

What began as a means of disproving my friend's denial of his ping pong inferiority grew to be a rather dedicated practice for the dozen-plus of us involved, which consisted of logging countless games and anticipating the results produced by downloading the sheet into .csv form and running the program. I've provided the .csv containing our log of records up to May 2018 as a template for input data. However, it should be noted that I include this data at the risk of exposing the debatably ludicrous amount of ping pong that I, as well as others, regularly engage in.
